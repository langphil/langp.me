As part of my day job as Digital Production Editor at the [Open Data Institute](http://theodi.org "ODI"){:target="_blank"} I think a lot about data and how as a raw material it can be used to tell stories and convey meaning. Below is an example of a data visualisation I commissioned, working with a wonderful London based data visualisation and digital journalism studio called **[Kiln](https://www.kiln.digital/ "Kiln"){:target="_blank"}**.

You can explore the visualisation below, or visit the [micro-site here](http://britains-diet.labs.theodi.org/ "Britain's diet in data"){:target="_blank"}  and read the official blog post from the ODI [here](http://theodi.org/blog/family-food-publication-day-blog-feeding-the-hunger-for-data "ODI Blog"){:target="_blank"}.

**The British diet has undergone a transformation in the last half-century. Traditional staples such as eggs, potatoes and butter have gradually given way to more exotic or convenient foods such as aubergines, olive oil and stir-fry packs.**

Explore the changes across four decades and hundreds of food and drink categories in this interactive visualisation, featuring data from the Department for [Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-environment-food-rural-affairs "Defra"){:target="_blank"}. Defra has just released almost 30 years of food diaries filled out by British families between the 1970s and 2000 as open data. This is part of #OpenDefra, and 2016: Year of Great British Food.

You can find out more about the history of the data and how some food categories have been described here.
