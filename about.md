Hello, I'm **Phil**. I'm a Web Developer and Creative Producer based in London.

#### A little bit about me
I'm a creative at heart. I'm also a bit of a data and privacy nerd. I aim to wield tech for good.

I've been living in London for the last 6 years. In that time I've worked with some amazing teams on challenges surrounding [open data](https://theodi.org/ "Open Data Institute") and [privacy / security](https://projectsbyif.com/ "Projects by IF").

I'm currently a Developer with the [Open Data Institute](https://theodi.org/ "Open Data Institute"), working on developing data publishing tools and prototyping around data portability in relation to p2p accommodation.

I can often be found with my head in a book standing at a bus stop. I also enjoy exploring London on my bike, running long distances, breathing and losing horribly at board games.
