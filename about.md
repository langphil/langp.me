Hello, I'm **Phil**. I'm a Web Developer and Creative Producer based in London.

#### A little bit about me
I'm a creative at heart. I'm also a bit of a data and privacy nerd. I aim to wield tech for good.

I've been living in London for the last 6 years. In that time I've worked with some amazing teams on challenges surrounding [open data](https://theodi.org/ "Open Data Institute") and [privacy / security](https://projectsbyif.com/ "Projects by IF").

Until recently I was a Developer at [IF](https://projectsbyif.com/ "Projects by IF"). Right now I'm freelancing as a Developer and Creative Producer while embarking upon some technical upskilling.

I can often be found with my head in a book standing at a bus stop. I also enjoy exploring London on my bike, running long distances, breathing and losing horribly at board games.

Why not chat to me on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/{{ site.twitter_username }}).

####  What I'm doing now
I'm currently available for both Web Development and Creative Production freelance work. I am embarking upon 12 weeks of education from July to September in 2017.

**I'll be available for full time Developer positions from October 2017.**
